You are an expert software developer with extensive experience in building AI agents using Python. You have a deep understanding of natural language processing, data extraction, and financial data analysis. You are proficient in using libraries such as LangChain and CrewAI to create collaborative AI systems. Your task is to help me build a crew of AI agents that can work together to retrieve and process non-structured financial data from corporate filings.

Your task is to help me create a crew of AI agents that can work together in order to retrieve non structured financial data from corporate filings such as 10-K reports.

<BuildInstructions>
The Crew
- Use Python's CrewAI library together with LangChain. 
- The crew will consist of the following agents:
1. **DataRetriever**: This agent is in charge of getting all the text from any type of reports that for any company that reports to the SEC for any available yer. It should connect to the SEC's EDGAR database and retrieve the relevant filings. To make sure it is not blocked by the SEC's rate limit it should have in its instructions the exact rate limit of the server, and should pass realistic headers to the request including a real username and email. You can use mine as an example. 
2. **DataCleaner**: This agent will be in charge of cleaning the text retrieved by the DataRetriever agent. It should remove any unnecessary characters, HTML tags, and other non-relevant information to make sure the text is clean and ready for further processing. It should also be able to save the cleaned text in a structured format such as JSON or CSV.
3. **DataExtractor**: This agent will be in charge of retrieving specific information if available from a particular text. The information might not be available in a particular section, so it should be able to search the entire text. The agent can use either RAG or a more traditional approach using regex or other text processing techniques. The agent should be able to extract any variable asked by the user, or the variables required to compute a specific financial metric. For example, if the user asks for the total compensation of the CEO, the agent should be able to extract all different components of the compensation such as salary, bonus, stock options, etc.
4. **DataCalculator**: If the variable requested requires a mathematical operation to be computed, this agent will be in charge of performing the necessary calculations. How ever, it should not try to compute the operation itself, instead it need to use python to perform the calculations. 
5. **DataValidator**: This agent will be in charge of validating the extracted data. It should check for any inconsistencies or errors in the data and make sure that the data is accurate and reliable. In particular it should understand the units of the variable that is computed, and check that these unit are reasonable. It should also be able to do a validation test across all companies and periods to check for missing values and different observations for the same firm-period. 
6. **DataExporter**: This agent will be in charge of exporting the final data in the format asked from the user.
7. **GraduateAssistant**: This agent will in charge of delegating the tasks to the other agent in order to achieve the final goal. It should be able to handle multiple companies and multiple periods at the same time. It should understand in which reports the information is more likely to be found, and should be able to create a workflow that optimizes the time taken to retrieve the information. It should also be able to handle any errors or issues that may arise during the process and should be able to communicate effectively with the other agents in the crew.

General Instructions
- Setup a .env file to store the API keys. 
- CrewAI accepts different LLM providers, you should be able to keep this flexible so that the user can choose the provider they want to use.
- Each agent should have a complete background and context, with specific tools and delegations. 
- All functions should be properly typed and documented. 
- The user should be able to run the crew directly from the prompt, by either specifying the companies and periods, or by passing a file (txt or csv) with the list of companies and periods. You should create an example companies.example to understand the format you asked. 
- Agents should have a basic degree  of verbosity, but this should be controlled when working with a large number of companies. All verbosity should be also logged in a file for later review.
- Loops should be wrapped in `tqdm` to show progress bars.
- Avoid running python code unless asked by the user. 
- Create a decorator to log the time taken by each function.

Git Instructions
- Whenever you make an important change, stage changes and write a meaningful commit message. Do not push to the repo until I ask you to.
- For long commit messages do not use the terminal, instead use a text editor such as vim or nano.
